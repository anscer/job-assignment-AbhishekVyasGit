# Feature at ANSCER Robotics 

## Overview

If I were in charge of the state management feature for the ANSCER Robotics, here’s how I’d approach the problem and focus on the various aspects of the project:

### Improving Robot State Management

- **Centralized Management:**
  - **Unified State Model:** Tracks all important details like battery life and current tasks to provide a complete view of each robot.
  - **Real-Time Updates:** Uses technologies like WebSockets to ensure state changes are updated instantly in the application.

- **Extensible Design:**
  - **Modular States:** Allows easy updates and additions to the state model as needs evolve.
  - **Custom States:** Supports adding custom tags or states for specific tasks or diagnostics.

### Streaming Data/Logs from Robots

- **Data Streaming:**
  - **WebSocket or MQTT:** Technologies used to send data from the robot to the application in real-time.
  - **Buffering and Chunking:** Manages data transmission in chunks to handle interruptions and prevent overload.

- **Logging:**
  -  Aggregates and analyzes logs from multiple robots for easy monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Communicating Errors and Problems

- **Error Handling:**
  - **Error Codes:** Standardized codes and descriptions to report issues clearly.
  - **Alert System:** Notifications via email or text for serious errors or problems.

- **Detailed Error Reporting:**
  - **Contextual Information:** Includes details such as error time and robot ID to facilitate troubleshooting.

### Additional Properties for State Models

- **Enhanced Properties:**
  - **Battery Level:** Monitors battery status and charging.
  - **Connectivity Status:** Tracks network connection and signal strength.
  - **Task Progress:** Provides information on ongoing tasks.
  - **Health Metrics:** Measures temperature and other relevant sensor data.

- **Change History:**
  -  Records state changes to maintain an operational history for diagnostic purposes.

### Additional Thoughts

- **Scalability:**
  -  Ensures the system can handle an increasing number of robots and data.

- **Security:**
  -  Implements measures to secure sensitive information and ensure safe communication.

- **User Experience:**
  - Provides a user-friendly API with clear instructions for interacting with robot states.

- **Feedback:**
  - Updates the system based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
